I also built and maintained these projects:

### [VVDocumenter-Xcode](https://github.com/onevcat/VVDocumenter-Xcode)
<span class="dim">Xcode Plugin</span>

An Xcode plug-in which helps you write documentation comment easier, for both Objective-C and Swift. In Xcode 8, Apple integrated a comment documentation generator plugin, which was built on top of VVDocumenter. This project is proud to be a part of Apple from 2016.

### [Rainbow](https://github.com/onevcat/Rainbow)
<span class="dim">Framework</span>

Delightful console output for Swift developers. Rainbow adds text color, background color and style for console and command line output in Swift. It is born for cross platform software logging in terminals, working in both Apple's platforms and Linux. 

### [Hedwig](https://github.com/onevcat/Hedwig)
<span class="dim">Framework</span>

Send email to any SMTP server like a boss, in Swift and cross-platform. With Hegwig, you could connect to any SMTP server from either a Linux server or macOS/iOS app written in Swift. It supplies a set of high level APIs to allow you to interact with SMTP much easier.

### [APNGKit](https://github.com/onevcat/APNGKit)
<span class="dim">Framework</span>

APNGKit is a high performance framework for loading and displaying APNG images in iOS. It's built on top of a modified version of libpng with APNG support and written in Swift. High-level abstractions of Cocoa Touch is used for a delightful API. Since be that, you will feel at home and joy when using APNGKit to play with images in APNG format.
